## Objectives
With VR technology becoming increasingly more common, the price and accessibility remain significant barriers to most people out there. Additionally, not only do you have to buy the VR equipment itself, you would also have to purchase the compatible console in order to operate it. While there are standalone ones (ones that do not require a console), its price is still comparable to setups that require you to have both the VR equipment and console. Our application addresses this problem by bringing full-body, interactive game play to more people by allowing users to play games on any personal devices that are equipped with a webcam/camera. As of now, there are not any games in the app store that use motion tracking through a device’s cameras to play the game that we are developing.
## Features
* Develop a mobile application that allows users to play games using motion tracking technology.
* Develop a game where users have to pose themselves in a way that fits the shape of holes in a moving wall (Hole in the Wall).
* Include motion tracking technology to allow users to move their character.
* Implement a statistics system to track a users’ progress and skill.
* Develop challenging missions that will test users’ ability.
  * Some potential missions that will be included are a speed up wall, secret mission, successfully passing through a certain number of walls without sustaining damage, inverted views (screen is inverted while player tries to fit the shape in original view), and disappearing views (shape disappears after some time).
* Have a database that stores cut outs of walls (models with keypoints, i.e. joints), course maps, and user statistics.
## Deliverables
* A mobile application created with React-Native and Pose Net allows users to play a game where they will have to pose themselves in a way that fits the shape of holes in a moving wall.
* User-friendly and aesthetic interface that creates an enjoyable and engaging environment for players. 
* A backend written in Python that connects to an AWS RDS database that contains necessary game information.
